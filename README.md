# Landing-Page

## Overview
- This is a project that I embarked upon for the purposes of my web development course, The Odin Project.
- It is a simple, modern and aesthetically pleasing landing page for a website, with placeholder text and images.
- The aim of the project was to demonstrate my proficiency with flexbox and other parts of CSS, in addition to HTML.
